# WordRush

## Game Description & Background

The game is heavily inspired by popular online typing games. Players have a limited amount of time to complete all sentences accurately and as quickly as possible before the timer runs out. The player wins by typing all the sentences while meeting the accuracy threshold. There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The harder the difficulty, the less time and higher accuracy the player needs to achieve.  

I created this game because I spent many hours playing online typing games and thought it would be fun to make my own, customizing it with unique features.
